Solutions to 2021 Advent of code. 

## Summary 

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual advent-calendar of programming puzzles. Here are my 2021 solutions in Golang. 

## Running the Code

To fetch the input, and create a template dir for each day: 

```shell
./new_day 2021 {day1}
```

To then run the solutions: 

```go
// using day1 as an example
cd day01 

// defaults to using input.txt in the current dir
go run main.go

// run with custom input (I normally use the test input given with the problem)
go run main.go test1.txt

```

## Runtimes

The results are found using a `BenchmarkMain` benchmark in each solution. This table is generated by running the `benchmark.sh` script.
